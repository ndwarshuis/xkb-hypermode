# xkb hypermode configuration

These are my personal bindings for xkb. They are quite hacky and likely won't be useful to anyone else as-is. Note this layout is only useful in combination with xcape (otherwise some very important keys would be missing).

A summary of the modification:
- based on English-US layout
- R-Ctrl = Caps Lock
- L-Ctrl = L-Hyper
- L-Super = embedded numpad modifier (with the 4 of the numpad on the j key)
- Space = R-Alt
- R-Alt = R-Hyper
- Caps Lock = L-Ctrl
- Return = R-Ctrl
- Tab = L-Super
- Backslash = R-Super
